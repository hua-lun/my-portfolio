      <h1>Let me tell you about my self-proclaim (mediocre) talent for Tetris</h1>
      <p>If you don't know already, I am obsessed with Tetris!</p>
      <p>This is a game that I will never get tired off.</p>
      <p>Tetris is easily to pick up, a no nonsense type of game.</p>
      <p>I play Tetris everyday. Specifically, Tetris99 on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>Although the experts might focus on techniques like getting T-Spins, attacking.</p>
      <p>I focus on speed and getting Tetris (clearing 4 lines in one shot).</p>
      <p>I find it pleasing and healing to clear the lines of Tetris.</p>
      <p>Hence, I would say I am better than the average Tetris player.</p>
      <p>(Haha, mainly because I play it so much.)</p>
